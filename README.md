**Project Description: Employee Management for HR - Demographics Analysis**

The "Employee Management for HR" project focuses on empowering Human Resources (HR) professionals with valuable insights into the employee demographics within the organization. Using a combination of SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for data visualization, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of the employee workforce.

**Data Collection and Preparation:**
As the foundation of the project, data is collected from diverse sources, such as HR databases, employee records, and performance evaluations. The collected data includes vital information about employees, such as gender, race/ethnicity, age, job titles, departments, hire dates, termination dates, and locations. The data is carefully prepared and cleansed to ensure accuracy and consistency.

**SQL Data Manipulation:**
To derive meaningful insights from the data, SQL queries are skillfully utilized to perform data manipulations and aggregations. The queries are tailored to calculate essential metrics, including employee counts, average tenure, turnover rates, and department-wise demographics. The flexibility of SQL allows for seamless data filtering and aggregation, providing HR professionals with relevant information.

**Power BI Visualization:**
Visual representation is a core element of the project, and Power BI serves as the ideal tool for this purpose. Power BI's diverse visualization capabilities are leveraged to create interactive and engaging charts and graphs. Each aspect of the employee demographics analysis is paired with suitable visualizations, such as pie charts, bar charts, histograms, and maps, to effectively communicate insights to HR stakeholders.
